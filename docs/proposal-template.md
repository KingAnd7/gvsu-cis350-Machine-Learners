# Introduction
Our project concept involves making a desktop client for users to track their workouts. We want our project to help guide people on their fitness and self care journeys.

We anticipate that this program will have several features that make it useful to our user base. We will also implement features to add readability and make our project more broadly useable.

Our feature ideas:
- A GUI to make our program easy to use
- A feature to track time spent in a workout
- A feature to allow users to input movements they've done throughout the workout
- A feature that will briefly describe to a user how to properly do a movement
- Potentially add images to each movement

# Anticipated Technologies
Python will be sufficient here. We will also use Git for version control, and possibly create a Jira board to ensure tasks get knocked out in a timely fashion.

# Method/Approach
We would each like to pour several hours a week into the project. We want to first get the GUI up and running. From there, we'll worry about implementing the workout tracking feature. The time feature should be fairly easy, so we will probably save that one for last.

# Estimated Timeline
The major milestones for this project will be:
Getting the GUI up and running. This will probably take us a couple of weeks of work. The longest part will be implementing each of the movements, with descriptions on how to do them. This will take the bulk of the semester to implement. Finally, we'll want to polish it off and make it run smoothly, and be aesthetically pleasing. This should take a few weeks as well.

# Anticipated Problems
*hopefully* we don't run in to any problems. Currently, we aren't antipating anything.
