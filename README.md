# The Machine Learners

A cool, very on fleek, dapper exercise desktop program. The exercise program will assist any potential users in maximizing their workout routine. They will be able to utilize the program in order to create the best and most efficient workout routine. They will have access to use a timer to keep track of their time spent working out. Users will also be able to find exercises that they can perform in order to achieve their ideal body physique. If they do not know how to perform an exercise, a tutorial will be provided for them. If multiple users ever wanted to use the program with multiple 'profiles', where settings will be saved for separate profiles. Using our program, the most skinniest person can turn themselves into the most jacked human being ever, making someone like Sam Sulek and Chris Bumstead jealous of your new body.
